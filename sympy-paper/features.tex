% Features to discuss in depth:
This section gives a basic introduction of SymPy, and lists its features.
A few features---assumptions, simplification, calculus, polynomials, printers,
solvers, and matrices---are core components of SymPy and are discussed in
depth. Many other features are discussed in depth in the supplementary
material.

\subsection{List of Features}

Although SymPy's extensive feature set cannot be covered in depth in this
paper, bedrock areas, that is, those areas that are used throughout the
library, are discussed in their own
subsections below. Additionally, Table~\ref{features-table} gives a compact listing
of all major capabilities present in the SymPy codebase. This grants a
sampling from the breadth of topics and application domains that SymPy
services. Unless stated otherwise, all features noted in
Table~\ref{features-table} are symbolic in nature. Numeric features are
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:numerics}.
